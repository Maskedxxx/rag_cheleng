We had cancelled this program in response to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic for the second half of fiscal 2020 and all of fiscal 2021, but reinstated an annual incentive cash compensation program for our CEO and CFO in fiscal 2022. For our other NEOs, the annual incentive compensation program was reinstated in fiscal 2022 with 50% of the target value in retention RSUs and 50% of the target value in cash. Our SVP, Worldwide Sales participated in this annual incentive compensation program (including the 50%/50% ratio between cash and retention equity) as to 25% of his target value and also participated in a separate incentive compensation program as to 75% of his target value that was tied to achievement of new financial targets for bookings and gross profit, measured on a non-GAAP basis."
