              "value": "Increasing competition among automotive retailers and the use of the internet reduces our profit margins on vehicle sales and related businesses. Automotive retailing is a highly competitive business. Our competitors include publicly and privately owned dealerships, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Many of our competitors sell the same or similar makes and models of new and used vehicles that we offer in our markets at competitive prices. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers due to economies of scale or otherwise. We typically rely on advertising, merchandising, sales expertise, customer service reputation and dealership location to sell new vehicles. In addition, our F&I business and other related businesses, which have higher margins than sales of new and used vehicles, are subject to competition from various financial institutions and other third parties. Our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected if certain state dealer franchise laws are relaxed to permit manufacturers to enter the retail market directly. Moreover, consumers are using the internet to compare pricing for vehicles and related F&I services, which may further reduce margins for new and used vehicles and profits for related F&I services. If internet-based new vehicle sales are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers, our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, other dealership groups have aligned themselves with services offered on the internet or are investing heavily in the development of their own internet sales capabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Challenges to the business model of our franchised dealerships from manufacturers and the effect of companies entering into the automotive space may affect our ability to grow or maintain the business over the long term. Large and well-capitalized technology-focused companies have continued to enter into the automotive space in recent years. Companies including, but not limited to, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Lucid Group, Inc., Lyft, Inc., Rivian Automotive, Inc., Tesla, Inc. and Uber Technologies, Inc. may challenge the existing automotive manufacturing, retail sales, maintenance and repair, and transportation models. For example, Tesla, Inc. has been challenging state dealer franchise laws in many states with mixed results, but it has achieved success with new vehicle sales business model and its vehicles have been accepted by many consumers, even in states where dealer franchise laws appear to preclude such vehicle sales. In addition, other manufacturers whose new vehicles we sell have recently announced their intentions to implement an “agency” model of direct manufacturer to consumer sales in certain European markets. Although the long-term impact of the participation of vehicle manufacturers in direct sales is undetermined, these other large companies may continue to change consumers’ view on how automobiles should be manufactured, equipped, retailed, maintained and utilized in the future. Because these companies have the ability to connect with each individual consumer easily through their existing or future technology platforms, we may ultimately be at a competitive disadvantage in marketing, selling, financing and servicing vehicles. In addition, certain automobile manufacturers have expressed interest in or begun selling directly to customers. The franchised dealer’s participation in that potential future transaction type is unclear and our operations and financial results may be negatively impacted if the role of franchised dealers diminishes. Our dealers depend upon new vehicle sales and, therefore, their success depends in large part upon consumer demand for and manufacturer supply of particular vehicles. The success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry. New vehicle sales generate the majority of our total revenue and lead to sales of higher-margin products and services such as finance, insurance, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products, and parts and service operations. Our new vehicle sales operations are comprised primarily of luxury and mid-line import brands, which exposes us to manufacturer concentration risks. Although our parts and service operations and used vehicle and powersports businesses may serve to offset some of this risk, changes in automobile manufacturers’ vehicle models and consumer demand for particular vehicles may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business is highly dependent on consumer demand and preferences. Events such as manufacturer recalls and negative publicity or legal proceedings related to these events may have a negative impact on the products we sell. If such events are significant, the profitability of our dealerships related to those manufacturers could be adversely affected and we could experience a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations, financial position and cash flows."

In addition, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the Sonic Automotive, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan or the Sonic Automotive, Inc. 2012 Formula Restricted Stock and Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors and other obligations become immediately exercisable or automatically vest upon a change in control. Delaware law also makes it difficult for stockholders who have recently acquired a large interest in a company to consummate a business combination transaction with the company against its directors’ wishes. Finally, our franchise and dealer agreements allow the manufacturers the right to terminate the agreements upon a change of control of the Company and impose restrictions upon the transferability of any significant percentage of our stock to any one person or entity that may be unqualified, as defined by the manufacturer, to own one of its dealerships. The inability of a person or entity to qualify with one or more of our manufacturers may prevent or seriously impede a potential takeover bid. In addition, there may be provisions of our lending arrangements that create an event of default upon a change in control. These agreements, corporate governance documents and laws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control or preventing stockholders from realizing a premium on the sale of their shares if we were acquired. Potential conflicts of interest between us and our officers or directors could adversely affect our future performance. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Bruton Smith, also serves as a director of Speedway Motorsports. Accordingly, we compete with Speedway Motorsports for the management time of Mr. Smith. Further, Mr. Smith, members of his family and certain trusts, the beneficiaries of which are members of the Smith family, directly and indirectly control a substantial majority of our voting stock. We will likely in the future enter into transactions with Mr. Smith, entities controlled by Mr. Smith and his family or our other affiliates. We believe that all of our existing arrangements with affiliates are as favorable to us as if the arrangements were negotiated between unaffiliated parties, although the majority of these transactions have neither been verified by third parties in that regard nor are likely to be so verified in the future. Potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us and our officers or directors in the enforcement, amendment or termination of arrangements existing between them. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the state and federal courts of Delaware as the exclusive forums for certain claims against the Company, which could increase the costs of bringing a claim or limit the ability of a stockholder to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by a stockholder as favorable. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for claims for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Sonic (other than derivative actions brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder); (2) any action asserting a claim of a breach of, or based on, a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of Sonic to Sonic or Sonic’s stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against Sonic or any current or former director, officer, or other employee or stockholder of Sonic arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against Sonic governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws also provide that, unless the Board otherwise consents in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Exchange Act or any ancillary claims related thereto which are subject to the ancillary jurisdiction of the federal courts. The exclusive forum provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may increase the costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he, she or it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors, officers or other employees. Such provisions may also discourage lawsuits against the Company or the Company’s directors, officers and other employees. The Delaware courts or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than to our stockholders."
