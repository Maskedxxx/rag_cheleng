The categories range from 'Well capitalized' (highest requirements) to 'Critically undercapitalized' (lowest thresholds). For instance, to be considered well-capitalized, an institution needs a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 10.0% and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5.0%. The critically undercapitalized category is solely determined by Tangible Equity to Assets ratio being less than 2.0%."
