We see the increasing regulatory focus which we believe we have is a competitive strength of ours. We believe that increasing interest rates and the challenge competition are facing with their path to profitability as being new and positive tailwinds for us, because our team, our execution, have never been better. Our customers are experiencing that and our investors are seeing that. There are still several risks we must navigate – most notably the increase in cyber risk, increasing societal expectations of good governance, and in the war for talent. However, we feel as well placed as ever to manage those on your behalf, as we continue to build a strong, sustainable Company. I want to thank my fellow Directors for their dedication and commitment when the Company needed it. Their dedication is extraordinary, especially in the context of more scrutiny, more time that is required for mergers and acquisitions, and higher expectations from investors. Finally, on behalf of our clients and our partners, I want to thank Skander and the OFX team for their extraordinary hard work, skill and perseverance in these uncertain times."
