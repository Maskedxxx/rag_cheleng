(2) Upon termination of employment for death, disability or retirement, Mr. Hall will be paid a prorated STIP bonus based on his actual performance for the year. For the purpose of this calculation, the value reported is the full year STIP bonus amount paid to Mr. Hall for 2022. (3) Upon termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason within a CIC Protection Period, Mr. Hall will be paid the sum of (i) three times his then current base salary, and (ii) three times the average STIP bonus paid during the last three years preceding his date of termination. (4) Amounts are equal to the Accrued Liability Retirement Balance at December 31, 2022, for Mr. Hall. If Mr. Hall is terminated without Cause or resigns prior to the age of 65, Mr. Hall will receive, as severance compensation over 15 annual installments starting on the date he turns 65, an amount equal to the accrued balance with interest, on the date of his termination, of Mr. Hall’s liability reserve account. The number reported for the payment upon termination without Cause excludes interest that would be payable when payments begin being made when Mr. Hall turns 65. This value represents the value of the death benefit at December 31, 2022, payable to Mr. Hall’s beneficiary in a lump sum on the 1st day of the month after death. (5) (6) Mr. Hall’s SERP will pay, upon Mr. Hall’s retirement at age 65, an annual benefit of $118,939 that includes an annual 1.5% COLA increase, paid in equal installments until Mr. Hall’s death. Upon a CIC, if Mr. Hall is terminated, except for Cause, he will receive the annual benefit as if he had retired at the age of 65. The projected total retirement benefit of $2,910,499 assumes death at age 86 based on the MP 2015 Mortality table. Represents 100% of the Accrued Liability Retirement Balance as of the effective date of the termination or disability of Mr. Hall, which we assumed to be December 31, 2022. (7) Represents the present value of the benefits provided under the ESIA at December 31, 2022, in the event that Mr. Hall is involuntarily separated from service following a CIC, other than for Cause, using a three percent discount rate. (8) (9) Mr. Hall has an ESIA, effective October 29, 2019, that provides for, beginning at the age of 60 and irrespective of whether Mr. Hall retires, an annual amount equal to ten percent of Mr. Hall’s annualized base salary for the calendar year in which Mr. Hall attains the age of 60. The annual payments will begin within thirty days following Mr. Hall turning 60 and continue annually for six years. For purposes of estimating the payment amount, we assumed that Mr. Hall retired and turned 60 on December 31, 2022. (10) Represents 80% of the net-at-risk insurance portion of the proceeds at December 31, 2022. The net-at-risk insurance portion is the total proceeds less the cash value of the policy, which will be paid in a lump sum upon Mr. Hall’s death."
